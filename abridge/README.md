# abridge

This is going to be a pretty simple online bridge
game. I have no plans to implement partner finding
at all, so you'll need to hand your own friends.

It has a pretty crude AI to play against and can also give bidding advice based on a fixed bidding convention.

## Getting started with development:

```
git clone git@github.com:droundy/bridge-cards
cd bridge-cards/abridge
cargo run --release
```

And then point your browser at
[http://localhost:8087/random](http://localhost:8087/random) and you should be
able to play on your local version of the code.
